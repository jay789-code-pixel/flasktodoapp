# Project Report: Flask Todo App

## Introduction

Flask Todo App is a simple yet efficient web-based system for managing personal tasks. Built with Flask (Python), it demonstrates the principles of RESTful CRUD operations, template rendering, and database integration using SQLite.

## Implementation Details

- **Backend:** Developed with Flask. Implements routes for viewing, adding, updating, and deleting todos. Uses SQLAlchemy or Flask's built-in database connection for data storage.
- **Frontend:** HTML templates rendered with Jinja2. Styled using Bootstrap for responsiveness.
- **Database:** SQLite file-based persistence ensures data is retained between sessions.

## Features

- User can add new tasks.
- Tasks can be marked as completed or deleted.
- Todos are listed with dynamic status updates.
- Simple, minimal authentication/session handling.
- Responsive design for cross-device usability.

## Challenges

- Ensuring smooth UX for task updates and deletions.
- Managing state and session data.
- Balancing simplicity with extensibility for learning purposes.

## Future Improvements

- Add user authentication to support multiple users.
- Integrate due dates and priorities.
- Deploy on a public cloud (Heroku, Vercel, etc.).
- API endpoints for mobile integrations.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a full-stack web application with Python, focusing on practical use-cases. It can be adapted for further learning, serve as a portfolio project, or be extended into a production-ready system.
